# KattisSolutions
These are solutions that my team members or I have created for problems found on https://open.kattis.com/.  
The file name should be the same or similar to the problem title (not ID) on Kattis.  
Please use this code only as a reference and not as your own solution.
Some files may be in progress as I also use this repository to consolidate my solution files.
If you find any issues with my code please let me know.
